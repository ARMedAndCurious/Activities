    <p style="color: mediumblue;">Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and line an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper.
Heat the milk in a microwave-safe bowl for about 20 seconds until steaming. Combine the warm milk, 2 tablespoons of yogurt, both sugars, and vanilla in a large bowl and whisk until the mixture looks syrupy and the sugar has mostly dissolved.
In a small bowl, combine the remaining 2 tablespoons of yogurt with 2 tablespoons of flour. Stir vigorously until the mixture becomes thick, stringy, and tight like bread dough—this forms a gluten paste that replaces the structure eggs provide.
In a separate microwave-safe bowl, combine the chocolate and butter. Heat in 20-second increments, stirring between each, until completely melted and smooth.
Add the melted chocolate mixture to the milk-sugar mixture and whisk until fully combined, smooth, and glossy. Then whisk in the gluten paste until well incorporated.
Sift the remaining flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt over the batter and mix gently. Fold in the chocolate chips.
Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the surface. Tap the pan once or twice on the counter to settle air pockets.
Bake for about 35 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the center comes out with moist, sticky crumbs attached—do not overbake.
Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let the brownies cool completely in the pan before lifting them out using the parchment paper overhang and slicing</p>
